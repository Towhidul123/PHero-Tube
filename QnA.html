    <h2 class="py-3 font-bold text-2xl  ">Discuss the scope of var, let, and const</h1>
        <p class="italic">In JavaScript, var, let, and const are used to declare variables, but they have different scopes and behaviors.
            <br>
           <span class="font-bold"> Var:</span> Variables declared with var are function-scoped, meaning they are only accessible within the function in which they are declared.
            <br>
          <span class="font-bold"> Let:</span>  Variables declared with let have block scope, which means they are limited to the block (enclosed by {}) in which they are defined.
            <br>
           <span class="font-bold"> Const: </span>Variables are constants, which means their value cannot be reassigned after declaration.
       
        </p>
    
        <h2 class="py-3 font-bold text-2xl  ">Tell us the use cases of null and undefined</h1>
        <p class="italic">In JavaScript, both null and undefined are used to represent the absence of a value, but they are used in slightly different contexts and have different use cases
            <br>
            <span class="font-bold">Undefined:</span>When a variable is declared but not assigned a value, it is automatically initialized to undefined.
            <br>
            <span class="font-bold">Null:</span>Unlike undefined, which often represents unintentional absence of value, null is typically used to represent the intentional absence of a value or the explicit clearing of an object or variable.
        </p>

        <h2 class="py-3 font-bold text-2xl  ">What do you mean by REST API?</h1>
        <p class="italic">REST API, which stands for Representational State Transfer Application Programming Interface, is a widely used architectural style for designing networked applications and web services. It is an approach that uses the principles of simplicity, statelessness, and standard HTTP methods to create scalable and maintainable web services. REST APIs are commonly used in client-server communication over the internet and are designed to be easy to understand and use.</p>
